# PERSONAL-PLANNER
To-Do List style application with an intuitive graphic interface. 
<Br/>

This is a term project made as a part of my CPSC 210 (Software Construction) class. <Br/>
This project demonstrates applications of core concepts of Object-oriented programming such as polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance, etc. <Br/>
This project also demonstrates usage of Swing library to create GUIs, JSON parsing using Gson library to get current weather information, and more. <Br/>
<Br/>

The two different interfaces of the program can be run by running 'RunGraphicInterfaceCompact.java' or 'RunGraphicInterface.java' <Br/>
